# This small piece of code can be helpful if you are trying to generate gray code patterns from scratch.

The approach is intuitive, you just need to adjust a few parameters for your own projects.


# Instructions

1. Open `thanh_graycode.py`
2. Change the following parameters
```
# Set initial parameters
im_h = 1080
im_w = 1920
# Number of bits
bit_no = 5
```
3. If necessary, make a gif and let it run, it looks cool.

## What I need from you
These few lines of code took me more time than I would like to admit. However, I do not come from programming background and it is my best try.

If possible, tell me how I can improve the code.

Also, feel free to use as needed, please also give credit/refer to my github.
